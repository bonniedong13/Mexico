    The first player will have a maxium of 3 rolls to get a number they're pleased with. 
    The number of times they roll is the number of times the 
rest of the players gets to roll. For example, if the first player rolled 2 times, everyone else has up to 2 rolls. 
    The numbers you roll will be 
combined into a two-digit number which is considered as your score. 
    There are certain score rules for Mexico: Double digit number (ex: 33) is 
higher than any mixed number (ex: 63) and the highest number you can get is 21 which is known as a Mexico. 
    Every player starts out 
with 5 chips and every round the lowest rolling player will lose a chip. Once you run out of chips you are out.
